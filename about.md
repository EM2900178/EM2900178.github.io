# About Me
Hello! I am EM my goals are, to graduate highschool, then advance my academic and athletic work into college, study engineering or utilities. 
   I enjoy playing baseball and football, working out and watching movies with family.

   My top choice would be going into an engineering career. The career stands out to me not just for the paycheck, but sketching out solutions, pitching ideas to a team, and standing out, solving issues, and accomplishing something as a team. It connects to my lifestyle goals so I can have a comfortable life with a big house while also still enjoying what I do. Collaboration, communication, and decision making would be very crucial for this career and if I demonstrate such abilities I can be successful.
